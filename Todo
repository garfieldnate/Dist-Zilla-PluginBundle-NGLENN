Revision history for Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-NGLENN

- Write some code
- Write some tests
- Replace boilerplate docs with real documentation
- Figure out how to replace NGLENN bundle with real dependencies in output dependencies for this distribution (authordeps, etc.); then this could be tested with Travis, which would be useful for making sure all of those dependencies are still OK (or for MDVT).
- See why x_contributors in meta has me twice with different names but same email
- See about patching Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ConfirmRelease to also include name of cpan account being uploaded to, and exact version number being uploaded (including TRIAL, if applicable).
- Perhaps find a way to upload releases to GitHub's releases API... Maybe not.

Dependent on others:
    - Put Git::CheckFor::CorrectBranch back in when the bug in File::NFSLock is fixed
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=99431
    - Hopefully eventually put MinimumVersion::Fast back when Dave Golden considers it stable enough
    - Git::Push always hangs, and Git::Commit sometimes as well.

    - Travis badge in readme would be nice, but currently would need to hardcode repo and username
        - https://github.com/Wu-Wu/Dist-Zilla-Plugin-TravisCI-StatusBadge/issues/2
    - Travis shouldn't bother testing perl versions below the minimum required version
